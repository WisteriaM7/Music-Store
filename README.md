# Music-Store
Music Store is a basic HTML webpage that showcases a collection of musical instruments. It features a header, product images, a YouTube video, a user input form, store locations, and brand listings. This project is perfect for beginners to understand the structure of an HTML document, form elements, tables, and multimedia embedding.
